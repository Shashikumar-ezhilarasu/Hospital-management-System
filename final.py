# To extend: Add authentication, export to CSV/PDF, or migrate to a web UI (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask).
# This code is designed to be run in a Python environment with access to the specified PostgreSQL database.
# Ensure psycopg2 is installed: pip install psycopg2-binary
# Update database credentials as needed.

#I have also tried creating a react based UI for this code, but it is working properly.i was thinking to add this feture as a component to it .
