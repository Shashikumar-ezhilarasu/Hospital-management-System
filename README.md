# Hospital Management Dashboard

A modern web application for viewing hospital management insights and analytics.

## Features

- Daily appointment list (filterable by doctor)
- Total revenue by service type
- Follow-up required for pregnancy results 
- Monthly list of IUI/OI/IVF procedures
- Success rate of IUI/OI/IVF procedures
- Month-over-month new patient registrations
- Geographic distribution (city, district, locality)
- Referral source breakdown
- Medicines expiring in next X days
- Medicines below reorder level

For pre-defined query execution check test3.py

For query generated by ai using gemini-api check the app.py
also create .env file and add your gemini api key there.




I have also tried creating a react based UI for this code, but it is working properly.
i was thinking to add this feature as a component to the current project.
